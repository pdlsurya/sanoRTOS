# sanoRTOS
sanoRTOS is a minimal Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) designed for ARM Cortex-M and RISC-V microcontrollers. This implementation provides a simple yet effective API for task management, synchronization, and communication, enabling efficient and predictable multitasking in embedded systems.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Priority-Based Preemptive Scheduling**  
  Efficient task management with support for preemptive scheduling based on task priority levels.

- **Optional Privileged and User-Level Tasks**
  Supports the differentiation between privileged (kernel) tasks and user-level tasks. Privileged tasks have access to critical system resources and can execute sensitive operations, 
  while user-level tasks operate with restricted permissions to enhance system security and stability. This separation allows for better isolation and protection between tasks of 
  different trust levels, ensuring that critical system operations are secure from user-level task interference.

- **Optional Priority Inheritance**  
  Prevents priority inversion during mutex acquisition by temporarily elevating the priority of lower-priority tasks.

- **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) Support**  
  Fully supports multi-core systems with per-task **core affinity** configuration for optimal load balancing.

- **Dynamic Stack Overflow Detection**  
  Runtime monitoring of task stacks to catch and handle stack overflows proactively.

- **Configurable Tick Rate**  
  Easily adjustable tick frequency to match application-specific timing and power requirements.

- **Task Synchronization Primitives**  
  Includes mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables for safe and efficient coordination between tasks.

- **Inter-Task Communication**  
  Enables message passing between tasks using message queue.

- **Minimalistic and Lightweight Design**  
  Designed for embedded systems with limited resources â€” small footprint, fast context switches, and no unnecessary bloat.

# Building and Running
## Example for STM32Cube IDE

1. Clone the Repository:
   - Open a terminal and clone the sanoRTOS repository
     `git clone https://github.com/pdlsurya/sanoRTOS.git`
2. Open STM32Cube IDE:

   - Launch STM32Cube IDE and create a new STM32 project or open an existing one.

3. Include sanoRTOS in Project:
   - Right-click on your project and select **Properties**.
   - Go to **C/C++ Build > Settings**.
   - Under **Tool Settings**, go to **MCU GCC Compiler > Include paths** and add the path to **sanoRTOS/include** and **sanoRTOS/ports/arm/stm32/include** directory.

4. Add Source Files:
   - Navigate to **C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols**.
   - In the **Source Location** tab, click on **Link folder** and add the path to **sanoRTOS/source** and **sanoRTOS/ports/arm/stm32** directory by selecting **Link to folder in the filesystem**.
     
6. Edit **stm32xxxx_it.c** file:
   - STM32 initializes the SysTick timer during its clock initialization process and defines the `SysTick_Handler` ISR function for the implementation of the delay function in the 
   **Core > Src > stm32xxxx_it.c** file. Hence, the `SysTick_Handler` ISR function cannot be redefined inside the sanoRTOS. Instead, we need to call the function `osSysTick_Handler` from the `SysTick_Handler` ISR function.
    
   - Moreover, **sanoRTOS** includes definition for `PendSV_Handler` and `SVC_Handler` ISRs used for task scheduling and context switching. STM32 also 
   defines these ISRs in **stm32xxxx_it.c** file; Hence, we need to remove the definition of these ISRs from the **stm32xxxx_it.c** file to avoid multiple definition error. 

## Example for RP2350(Raspberry Pi pico 2) using pico-sdk
1. Clone the Repository:
   - Open a terminal and clone the sanoRTOS repository
     `git clone https://github.com/pdlsurya/sanoRTOS.git`

2. Set Up Your Pico Project:
  - You can either create a new CMake-based Pico SDK project or add sanoRTOS to an existing one. Add sanoRTOS folder to your project folder
  - sanoRTOS supports both ARM and RISC-V cores of the RP2350.

3. Include sanoRTOS in Your CMakeLists.txt:
  - Update your CMakeLists.txt to include sanoRTOS headers and sources as follows:

```cmake

file(GLOB_RECURSE SANORTOS_SRCS
    sanoRTOS/source/*.c
    sanoRTOS/ports/arm/rp2350/port.c)
#for Hazard3 RISC-V cores, add source files from risc-v port of rp2350 (sanoRTOS/ports/riscv/rp2350/port.c and  sanoRTOS/ports/riscv/rp2350/port.S)

target_include_directories(project_name PRIVATE
   sanoRTOS/include
   sanoRTOS/ports/arm/rp2350/include #for RISC-V port replace this line  with sanoRTOS/ports/risc-v/rp2350/include 
) 
target_sources(project_name PRIVATE ${SANORTOS_SRCS})

```

## Example Code:
 
 ```c

#include "sanoRTOS/config.h"
#include "sanoRTOS/scheduler.h"
#include "sanoRTOS/task.h"
//Include MCU-specific header files here

// Define two tasks with 1024-byte stacks.
// These tasks are assigned to any available core using AFFINITY_CORE_ANY.
//
// On multicore MCUs (e.g. RP2350), sanoRTOS can schedule tasks on different cores
// depending on the affinity setting. AFFINITY_CORE_ANY allows the scheduler to choose any core.
// This can help distribute load across both cores and enable true parallel execution.
//
// On single-core MCUs, this setting is safely ignored â€” all tasks will run on the only available core.
TASK_DEFINE(task1, 1024, firstTask, NULL, 1, AFFINITY_CORE_ANY);
TASK_DEFINE(task2, 1024, secondTask, NULL, 1, AFFINITY_CORE_ANY);


// Task 1 function â€“ user-defined logic inside this loop
void firstTask(void *args) {
    while (1) {
        // Task1 code to run repeatedly
    }
}

// Task 2 function â€“ user-defined logic inside this loop
void secondTask(void *args) {
    while (1) {
        // Task2 code to run repeatedly
    }
}

int main() {
    // Perform MCU-specific initializations here
    // Example: initialize GPIO, UART, peripherals, etc.

    // Start tasks
    taskStart(&task1);
    taskStart(&task2);

    // Start the sanoRTOS scheduler (will not return)
    schedulerStart();

    // Control should never reach here if scheduler is working correctly
    return 0;
}
```
